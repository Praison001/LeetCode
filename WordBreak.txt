Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words,
 determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note:

The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
Example 2:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
Example 3:

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false

Using dynamic programming
class Solution:
    # @param s, a string
    # @param dict, a set of string
    # @return a boolean
    def wordBreak(self, s, dict):
        n = len(s)
        f = [False for i in range(n+1)]
        f[0] = True
        for i in range(n):
            if f[i]:
                for j in dict:
                    l = len(j)
                    if i+l<=n and s[i:i+l] == j:
                        f[i+l] = True
        return f[n]
