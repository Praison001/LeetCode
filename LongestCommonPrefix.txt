zip is used for zipping elements in two lists, stores only iterables

class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        arrays= [[x for x in y]for y in strs]
        result= ""
        for item in zip(*arrays):
            if len(set(item))==1:
                result+= item[0]
            else:
                break
        return result
