Two Sum question

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

Better Solution using hash map
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        d=dict()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            num= nums[i]
            complement= target-num
            if num in d:
                return [d[num],i]
            else:
                d[complement]= i

Brute force solution (O(n^2))
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1,len(nums)):
                sum= nums[i] + nums[j]
                if sum==target:
                    return[i,j]
